## Basics

- Global storage platform
- Region based 
- Region Resilient
- Public service - runs from amazon public zone
- Objects and Buckets.

## Objects

- similar to files
- key: value (content)
- value can be from 0 bytes to 5 TB
- version id / meta data / access control / sub resources

## Buckets

- Created in specific region, linked to that region
- Bucket name - globally unique for all accounts/regions 
- bucket name -> 3-63 characters, all lower case, no underscores
- bucket name -> start with a lower case letter or a number
- bucket name -> can't be ip formatted e.g 1.1.1.1
- \#Buckets - 100 soft limit, 1000 hard per account
- Can hold unlimited bytes of data, infinite objects
- Flat structure
- Folders are often referred to prefixes

## Misc points
- S3 is object store - not file or block storage - only flat / can't use as mount point
- Great for large scale data storage, distrubution or upload
- Input and output to Many AWS products
  
## Bucket creation

- S3 is global specific, we need to select region while creating bucket
- Create S3 bucket, choose an unique name
- Block all public access, only general user and root user can access it.
- leave all other settings to default
- All resources in AWS have arn number
- Upload some files
- If bucket versioning is not there, upload with same key name will replace/rewrite the file.
- S3 don't have folders, it just emulates using prefixes
- Empty bucket and delete the bucket
