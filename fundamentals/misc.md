## High Availability

- aims to ensure an agreed level of operational performance
- usually uptime for a higher than normal period
- maximising application uptime
- fast recovery of system
- may need redundant servers
- disrutpions can happen
- minimize outages

## Fault tolerance

- continue to operate properly in event of failure of some of its components
- can be expensive/difficult to implement than HA
- minimize outages and also design in such a way to tolerate failure ( level of redundancy)

## Disaster recovery

- Set of procedures to enable recovery of failed infra
- DR process
